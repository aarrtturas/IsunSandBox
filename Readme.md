# How it works

Password can't be uplaoded to GitHub you will need to provide it as a parameter

Usage:
isun.exe -p "password" -c "city1,city2,city3"


Some settings:
```json
{
  "WeatherApi": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://weather-api.isun.ch/",
    "UserName": "isun",
    "DelayInSeconds":  15
  }
}
```

App initial structure is build with expansion in mind
